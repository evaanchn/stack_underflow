[[general_description]]
== General description 

A Battleship inspired game in which 6 different ships each implement an algorithm or data structure (Hashset, Red Black Tree, Binary Search, BTree, Splay Tree and Linear Search of a linked list) and face off in classical Battleship manner. Aside from unique ships, other innovations include health and cost for each singular-cell sized ship, upgrades available for each ship, and the option to move a ship. For each of the vessels, their search operation will be key to calculating the damage dealt to an opponent ship, if selected correctly, while the elimination operation will be fundamental to the ship's upgrading.
