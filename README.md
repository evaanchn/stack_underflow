## Projects

| ID | Name | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 01 | [Vessels of Order: Battle for the Seas](projects/project_01_vessels/readme.adoc) | A Battleship inspired game where 6 different ships implement algorithms and data structures in classical Battleship combat with health, cost, upgrades, and movement mechanics. |
| 02 | [Space Ops: Algorithms Conquest](projects/project_02_conquest/readme.adoc) | Space war game with three stages: probing, path-finding and attack. Each solar system represents a graph that can be explored with a variety of space ships controlled by a particular algorithm, with the goal of discovering all planets and defeating the bosses. |
| 03 | [Genetic Algorithms](projects/project_03_genetic_algorithm/readme.adoc) | Comparison of genetic algorithms, exhaustive recursion, and dynamic programming performance on NP complexity problems including subset sum, partition, bin packing, and double knapsack. |
